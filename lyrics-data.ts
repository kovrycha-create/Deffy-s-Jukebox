[00:05.24]Hello there, the angel from my nightmare
[00:08.20]The shadow in the background of the morgue
[00:11.20]The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
[00:14.70]We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
[00:17.70]Where you can always find me
[00:20.75]And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
[00:24.00]And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
[00:27.50]We'll wish this never ends
[00:30.50](I miss you, I miss you)
[00:37.00](I miss you, I miss you)
[00:42.50]Where are you?
[00:44.75]And I'm so sorry
[00:48.00]I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
[00:51.50]I need somebody and always
[00:54.60]This sick, strange darkness
[00:57.60]Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
[01:01.00]And as I stared, I counted
[01:04.00]The webs from all the spiders
[01:07.00]Catching things and eating their insides
[01:10.50]Like indecision to call you
[01:13.50]And hear your voice of treason
[01:16.80]Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
[01:20.00]Stop this pain tonight
[01:22.80]Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head
[01:27.00](I miss you, miss you)
[01:29.00]Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head
[01:33.50](I miss you, miss you)
[01:58.00]Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head
[02:02.00](I miss you, miss you)
[02:04.50]Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head
[02:08.50](I miss you, miss you)
[02:11.00]Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head
[02:15.00](I miss you, miss you)
[02:17.50]Don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head
[02:21.70](I miss you, miss you)
[02:24.00](I miss you, miss you)
[02:30.00](I miss you, I miss you)

[00:28.94]Am I more than you bargained for yet?
[00:33.01]I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
[00:37.04]'Cause that's just who I am this week
[00:41.23]Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
[00:45.39]I'm just a notch in your bedpost
[00:47.78]But you're just a line in a song
[00:49.78](Drop a God to a...)
[00:51.10]We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
[00:54.34]And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
[00:57.75]I'll be your number one with a bullet
[01:00.67]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

[01:14.07]A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
[01:17.65]Is this more than you bargained for yet?
[01:22.04]Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
[01:26.33]Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
[01:30.17]Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
[01:34.54]I'm just a notch in your bedpost

I've been staring at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
